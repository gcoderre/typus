= 3.1.0 (unreleased)

 * [NEW] Mountable apps support!

 * [NEW] Filter with scopes.

 * [NEW] Three different actions to save a record.

 * [CHANGED] Now we have a dashboard for every installed application.

 * [NEW] Chosen (http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/)

 * [CHANGED] We now support data types, which is basically a cleaner way to
   add support to future data models. (Eg. CarrierWave)

 * [CHANGED] Dragonfly attachments now also show details. (Size, date ...)

 * [CHANGED] Improved usability by using Fancybox to add new related records.

 * [NEW] Bulk actions.

 * [FIXED] We should be able to use namespaced models with more than 2 levels
   of namespace.

 * [CHANGED] We can't longer set models as "Read Only" from the configuration
   files, this was interesting but not really usefull as anyone could mass-assign
   attributes. Now to set an attribute as "Read Only" you only need to protect
   it using "attr_protected".

 * [CHANGED] Removed "Autocomplete" module.

 * [NEW] Typus is now tested with Travis-CI.

   templates provided by Devise.

   default authentication mechanism for my new apps.

= 3.0.8 (unreleased)

 * [FIXED] Missing alias. (Commit 2af7d4cfd98bb0)

= 3.0.7

 *[CHANGED] Updated assets. Please run the `typus:assets` generator in order
  to create the new files on the new location.

= 3.0.3

 * [NEW] Support for has many through relationships. [jmeiss]

 * [CHANGED] Removed typus pagination module and use `will_paginate` one.
   Pagination options can be configure overriding `Typus.pagination` variable.

 * [FIXED] Queries are now using the table name. [tyx]

 * [NEW] All queries are `unscoped` so we can separate completely the frontend
   from the backend.

 * [NEW] We can disable sortable tables.

   template is not `_paperclip.html.erb`.

   after a usability test with a client.

 * [CHANGED] Updated jQuery to v1.4.4

 * [CHANGED] Updated fancybox to v1.3.4

 * [NEW] New generator: `rails generate typus:assets`.

 * [NEW] Created UserVoice (http://typuscms.uservoice.com/)

 * [CHANGED] Table of contents on documentation for easier access.

 * [CHANGED] Display `&mdash;` where no content is available.

 * [NEW] `Admin::ResourcesController` includes `Typus::Extensions` if available.

 * [CHANGED] Removed `remove_filter_link` helper in favour of predefined links
   to filters.

 * [NEW] Custom actions can be injected into table actions. This needs some
   refector to be more powerful (roles) but it works for now.

 * [CHANGED] All the I18n stuff of `typus` is now under Typus::I18n namespace.

 * [CHANGED] AdminUser::LANGUAGES becomes AdminUser::LOCALE so you'll have to
   update your AdminUser.

 * [NEW] Better application templates.

= 3.0.2

 * [FIXED] Use Arel to get the data on lists. After moving to will_paginate I
   broke the data method, on each list we where "selecting ALL on the table of
   the current model" (Really ugly bug) [Reported by NateW]

 * [FIXED]* If @current_user was being set many times on each request, thanks
   to Rails caching mechanism this was not affecting to the performance. Now we
   only see the @current_user once. (As it should be.)

= 3.0.1

 * [FIXED] After moving from a vendored paginator to will_paginate I removed
   some stuff which shouldn't be removed, so the 3.0.0 gem is totally broken.

 * [FIXED] Force query with postgresql adapter to not be case sensitive [jmeiss]

= 3.0.0

 * [NEW] New gem version compatible with Rails 3.

= Previously

Why a 3.0.0 version? After considering the work done for the Rails 3 transition
I though it would be a good idea to keep versions syncronized with Rails.

Typus will have the same version numbers as Rails as I considered it's pretty
tied to it. With each release of Rails, we will take the latest features into
Typus.

Pending stuff that someday will be done, donations and collaborations are
accepted.

* Add AJAX, specially when removing and adding new relationships.

* Transversal search and full models search.

* Test the helpers and add some functional testing.

* Nested models.

* Contextual content depending on the role logged.

* Replace typus authentication by devise.
